        <p>I am a huge fan of EA Sports' FIFA games. In particular, a game mode called "Career mode" that allows you to manage a team for 15 seasons and win trophies with them.
          One of the most fun ways to play this game mode is by starting as a team in the 4th division of England (EFL League 2) and taking them to the Premier League.
          A new feature to this year's game is that now you can create your own team and put them into FIFA career mode. Naturally I decided to choose Brandeis FC, the club soccer
          team at Brandeis University that I play on. Most of the players on the team are auto-generated and are not real people but I did create myself and my friend Eric Wang.
          This website is meant to mimic an actually soccer team's website but with my career mode edition of Brandeis FC. I am doing this in order to practice my web development
          skills with HTML, css, and javascript. You can read more about my motivation for creating this website on the about page.
           I hope you enjoy this website!
