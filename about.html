        <h4 style="color: white; text-align: center"><b>Motivation for this Website</b></h4>
        <p style="text-align: left">There are two main reasons for the creation of this website (other than resume purposes):
          <br>
          <br>
          <u>Past Career Modes:</u>  I have done similar road to glory career modes in past FIFA games.
          Most notably was my FIFA 21 save with Morecambe FC, another 4th division English side at the time.
          This was by far the save that I had put the most effort into, playing 11 seasons with the club and winning every trophy there was to win.
          Because I played this save for so long, I ended up falling in love with some of the players–mostly auto-generated academy players or regens–who had been on my team for many seasons and helped me achieve glory with Morecambe.
          One such player was an Italian winger named Paolo Ferrari, who was auto-generated into my youth academy when I first started the save. In my first season, he was only a 64 overall but by the time I was done with the save, he was the best player in the world at 95 overall and was the captain of my team.
          With players like Paolo Ferrari, I wished that I had kept a better track of their statistics and achievements in the game, that way I could have a record for just how much these club legends had accomplished for me in the career mode.
          Thus, for my newest career mode, I have decided to take stats for each player to see who ends up becoming a club legend for Brandeis FC.

          <u>Not the Expert on Youtube:</u> Drew Morris, known as Not the Expert on Youtube, has made a name for himself through his dynasty series’ on NCAA Football 14.
          In these series’, Morris will create or use a created college that starts off as a very poor football program.
          He will then proceed to turn this terrible team into perennial national champions.
          To keep his playthrough’s entertaining, Morris will often come up with backstories for his players to get his fans to fall in love with his players, which is where my motivation to do the same for my career mode players comes from.
          Additionally, due to his following, fans of NTE’s have created websites for his UGF and DVSU teams as if they were real teams.
          This is evidently where my motivation for the creation of this website comes from. Below are links to one of NTE’s videos and one of said fan websites:
